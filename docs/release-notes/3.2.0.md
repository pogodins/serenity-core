# Serenity 3.2.0

Serenity 3.2.0 contains a number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:
- Improved performance in report generation
- Updated the Page Elements API (https://serenity-bdd.github.io/documentation/docs/guide/page_elements)
- Improved requirements reporting to include more comprehensive requirements tables and better support for deep requirements hierarchies
- Collections of elements retrieved with findAll() methods and then processed (e.g. `findAll(".myelements").texts()`) will now automatically requery if a stale element exception occurs. You can disable this behaviour by setting the `webdriver.retry.on.stable.element.exception` property to false.
- Improved Playwright/Screenplay integration
- Support for @singlebrowser annotation in Cucumber scenarios
