# Serenity 3.1.0

Serenity 3.1.0 is a major new release of Serenity BDD. Some of the more significant changes in Serenity 3.1.0 include:
- Integration with Selenium 4 and Appium 8
- Improved reporting, including reporting on test duration
- New responsive report layout
- Use the `serenity.report.accesibility` property to render reports using patterns instead of plain colors patternomaly
- Filtering Cucumber scenarios (e.g. using the "cucumber.filter.tags" option will now exclude filtered features from appearing in the reports, allowing more focused reporting)
- Added the WebDriverManagerEnhancer interface, which allows you to write custom code to integrate with the more advanced WebDriverManager features from within Serenity.
- Chrome is now the default browser
- Added the SingleBrowser annotation and tag which can be used in JUnit or Cucumber to run all the scenarios in a test suite, feature or scenario outline in a single browser instance
- Added the InTheBrowser task which makes it easier to perform direct WebDriver operations from within a Screenplay task, e.g.
```
  actor.attemptsTo(
              InTheBrowser.perform(
                 browser -> browser.evaluateJavascript("window.localStorage.clear()")
             )
         );
```
- Added support for Chrome DevTools, via the `getDevTools()` method available in PageObjects and UIInteractionSteps classes, or via the `WithDevTools` screenplay task:
```
  actor.attemptsTo(
            WithDevTools.perform(
                  devTools -> devTools.createSession()
              )
  );
```
